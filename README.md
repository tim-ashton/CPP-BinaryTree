CPP-BinaryTree
==============

A binary tree class in C++ as an eclipse C++ project created on Ubuntu Linux.

This binary tree class demonstrates the use of recursive functions to implement insert and delete functions as well as pre-order, in-order and post-order traversal of a tree data structure.

I use Valgrinde to profile the class and detect memery leaks; no issues reported by Valgrind.
